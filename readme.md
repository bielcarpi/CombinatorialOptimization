## Features
- [x] Two problems to solve, Labyrinth & Letter Soup (with Graphical Interface)
- [x] Solve them with Backtracking, Branch & Bound or using a Greedy approach
- [x] Compare performance of the algorithms

## How To Use
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/bielcarpi/CombinatorialOptimization.git

# Open the project on IntelliJ and Run it (tested with Java 17)
# On the main() there is a detailed explanation of how the program works, and what
#  attributes can be modified so as to modify its execution.
```
